As I near the end of my Software Engineering experience with Flatiron, I reflect on where I began - little to no knowledge of coding or programming whatsoever and limited computer/technical skills. My journey has led me to gain a comprehensive knowledge of computer programming languages, and how to implement those languages in a fullstack web development environment. 

I have spent the last 10 months learning, struggling, problem solving, researching and building an online presence/network in order to gain the skills nessecary to become a full stack web developer. 

When first starting the bootcamp, I anticipated graduating on time at the expected 20 week mark. I struggled with understanding some languages and preparing for project reviews, which led me to switching cohorts and ultimately pushing my completion date back. There were times I felt I had failed, not given my best efforts, or that I just wasn't "meant to be a programmer."

I pushed through the negative thoughts, kept a goal in mind, and stayed on track. Today, I am extremely proud of myself for not giving up and ultimately reaching my goal - even if it took a bit longer than I anticipated. Flatiron has taught me to power through when my mindset is anything but positive, create and utilize a community online - we are in this together! And to remain confident in myself when things don't go as planned. I'm proud to be a part of the coding community, and I can't thank Flatiron enough for making it possible!
